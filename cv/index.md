## Education

* **MSc Software Engineering**, Sharif University of Technology, 2013-2015, Grade: 17/20
    * _Thesis:_ "**Profile-Driven Traffic Classification**", Dr R. Jalili  
      _Category:_ Computer Networks::Network Security::Traffic Analysis  
      Traffic classification is the act of inferring useful information from the large volume of network packets. In my project, I used the idea
      of user profiling and clustering to provide a robust method for differentiating QoS based on users' behavior. The traffic classification
      method is based on applying machine learning algorithms to visible characteristics of packet flows, like packets' sizes and timing. A working
      (but not scalable) prototype of the proposed method was implemented & successfully tested in real-world settings.
    * _Courses:_ Distributed Systems, Data Mining, Software Development Methodologies, Advanced Topics in Software Engineering (Software Evolution),
       Formal Specification & Verification, Semantic Web

* **BSc Software Engineering**, Sharif University of Technology, 2009-2013, Grade: 17.6/20
    * _BSc Project:_ "**[Feature Location in Android Applications][flp]**", Dr Heydarnoori  
      _Category:_ Automated Software Engineering::Software Evolution::Feature Location  
      Feature Location is a technique for finding a specific part of code (e.g. the code for the spell checker in a word processor), called a
     feature, in large codebases using automated algorithms and tools. In this project, I proposed and implemented a feature location method
     for Android applications.
    * _Courses:_ OO-Design, Software Engineering, System Analysis & Design, Web Development, Database, Algorithms, OS, Network, Network Security
